On Python 3.10 or later, the installation scheme backend has been changed to use
``sysconfig``. This is to anticipate the deprecation of ``distutils`` in Python
3.10, and its scheduled removal in 3.12. For compatibility considerations, pip
installations running on Python 3.9 or lower will continue to use ``distutils``.
